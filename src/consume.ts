/**
 * Wraps a kafkajs eachMessage handler with Sol's decode/reject/retry policy
 * (kafka_service_intf.ml's wrap_on_decode_error + worker.ml's messages_total
 * split), so the two failure classes below can't be conflated by a caller:
 *
 *   - Decode/validation failure: the message will never become valid no
 *     matter how many times it's redelivered. This is a REJECTION, not a
 *     crash and not a retry -- decodeErrorCounter.inc() fires, the offset is
 *     implicitly committed (this function returns normally, kafkajs commits),
 *     and `decode`/`handler` is never invoked for this message. It is NOT a
 *     messages_total status value -- real worker.ml intercepts it before the
 *     handler ever runs, so it must not share a label with success/failure.
 *   - Handler failure (e.g. a downstream DB error) on an otherwise-valid
 *     message: this function re-throws, so kafkajs's own retry policy
 *     retries the message rather than silently treating it as rejected.
 *
 * FEAT-033's hand-rolled TS port got this wrong twice across two independent
 * adversarial review rounds -- first conflating both failure classes under
 * one label, then (separately, see wireCrashListener below) exiting on every
 * consumer crash including ones kafkajs was already self-healing from. This
 * is the single clearest piece of evidence that this policy doesn't transfer
 * by "just writing idiomatic TypeScript" -- it's worth encoding once.
